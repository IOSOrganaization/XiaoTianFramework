    \b,outside of a [Set]   Match if the current position is a word boundary. Boundaries occur at the transitions between word (\w) and non-word (\W) characters, with combining marks ignored. For better word boundaries, see useUnicodeWordBoundaries.
    \b, within a [Set]      Match a BACKSPACE, \u0008.
    \B                      Match if the current position is not a word boundary.

    \                       Quotes the following character. Characters that must be quoted to be treated as literals are * ? + [ ( ) { } ^ $ | \ . /
    Regular Expression Operators
    Table 2 defines the regular expression operators.
    
    Table 2
    Regular Expression Operators
    Operator                Description
    |                       Alternation. A|B matches either A or B.
    *                       Match 0 or more times. Match as many times as possible.
    +                       Match 1 or more times. Match as many times as possible.
    ?                       Match zero or one times. Prefer one.
    {n}                     Match exactly n times.
    {n,}                    Match at least n times. Match as many times as possible.

    ??                      Match zero or one times. Prefer zero.
    {n}?                    Match exactly n times.
    {n,}?                   Match at least n times, but no more than required for an overall pattern match.
    {n,m}?                  Match between n and m times. Match as few times as possible, but not less than n.
    *+                      Match 0 or more times. Match as many times as possible when first encountered, do not retry with fewer even if overall match fails (Possessive Match).
    ++                      Match 1 or more times. Possessive match.
    ?+                      Match zero or one times. Possessive match.

    (...)                   Capturing parentheses. Range of input that matched the parenthesized subexpression is available after the match.
    (?:...)                 Non-capturing parentheses. Groups the included pattern, but does not provide capturing of matching text. Somewhat more efficient than capturing parentheses.
    (?>...)                 Atomic-match parentheses. First match of the parenthesized subexpression is the only one tried; if it does not lead to an overall pattern match, back up the search for a match to a position before the "(?>"
    (?# ... )               Free-format comment (?# comment ).
    (?= ... )               Look-ahead assertion. True if the parenthesized pattern matches at the current input position, but does not advance the input position.
    (?! ... )               Negative look-ahead assertion. True if the parenthesized pattern does not match at the current input position. Does not advance the input position.
    (?<= ... )              Look-behind assertion. True if the parenthesized pattern matches text preceding the current input position, with the last character of the match being the input character just before the current position. Does not alter the input position. The length of possible strings matched by the look-behind pattern must not be unbounded (no * or + operators.)
    (?<! ... )              Negative Look-behind assertion. True if the parenthesized pattern does not match text preceding the current input position, with the last character of the match being the input character just before the current position. Does not alter the input position. The length of possible strings matched by the look-behind pattern must not be unbounded (no * or + operators.)
    (?ismwx-ismwx: ... )    Flag settings. Evaluate the parenthesized expression with the specified flags enabled or -disabled. The flags are defined in Flag Options.
    (?ismwx-ismwx)          Flag settings. Change the flag settings. Changes apply to the portion of the pattern following the setting. For example, (?i) changes to a case insensitive match.The flags are defined in Flag Options.
    Template Matching Format
    The NSRegularExpression class provides find-and-replace methods for both immutable and mutable strings using the technique of template matching. Table 3 describes the syntax.
    
    Table 3
    Template Matching Format
    Character               Descriptions
    $n                      The text of capture group n will be substituted for $n. n must be >= 0 and not greater than the number of capture groups. A $ not followed by a digit has no special meaning, and will appear in the substitution text as itself, a $.
    \                       Treat the following character as a literal, suppressing any special meaning. Backslash escaping in substitution text is only required for '$' and '\', but may be used on any other character without bad effects.
    The replacement string is treated as a template, with $0 being replaced by the contents of the matched range, $1 by the contents of the first capture group, and so on. Additional digits beyond the maximum required to represent the number of capture groups will be treated as ordinary characters, as will a $ not followed by digits. Backslash will escape both $ and \.
    
    Flag Options
    The following flags control various aspects of regular expression matching. These flag values may be specified within the pattern using the (?ismx-ismx) pattern options. Equivalent behaviors can be specified for the entire pattern when an NSRegularExpression is initialized, using the NSRegularExpression.Options option flags.
    
    Table 4
    Flag Options    Flag (Pattern)  Description
    i               If set,         matching will take place in a case-insensitive manner.
    x               If set,         allow use of white space and #comments within patterns
    s               If set,         a "." in a pattern will match a line terminator in the input text. By default, it will not. Note that a carriage-return / line-feed pair in text behave as a single line terminator, and will match a single "." in a regular expression pattern
    m                               Control the behavior of "^" and "$" in a pattern. By default these will only match at the start and end, respectively, of the input text. If this flag is set, "^" and "$" will also match at the start and end of each line within the input text.
    w                               Controls the behavior of \b in a pattern. If set, word boundaries are found according to the definitions of word found in Unicode UAX 29, Text Boundaries. By default, word boundaries are identified by means of a simple classification of characters as either “word” or “non-word”, which approximates traditional regular expression behavior. The results obtained with the two options can be quite different in runs of spaces and other non-word characters.
